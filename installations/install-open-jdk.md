# Install open-jdk

##### As usual make sure to update before installing new software

You can simply install the default version in the repositories

```
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

In case you want a specific open-jdk version you have to replace &lt;version&gt; with the version you want:

```
sudo apt install openjdk-<version>-jdk
```

As of today 26/04/2024 the latest full-released version is 22 which to install it would be like so:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-22-jdk
```
