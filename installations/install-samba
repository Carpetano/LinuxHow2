# Install samba

##### As usual make sure to update before installing new software

Install command:
```
sudo apt install samba -y
```

Edit the configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

At the end of the file add the folder and configuration, here's an example with full folder access for a user, replace the config with your needs 
```
[shared_folder_name]
    path = /path/to/folder
    available = yes
    valid users = youruser
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    public = no
    writable = yes
```

Set the permissions:
```
sudo chown -R youruser:youruser /path/to/folder
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/folder
```

Add samba user:
```
sudo smbpasswd -a youruser
```

Restart samba services and add an exapcion to firewall:
```
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
sudo ufw allow samba
```

<hr>

That should be it, now you should be able to access to the folder remotely.

Windows:
```
\\<machine_ip>\shared_folder_name
```
